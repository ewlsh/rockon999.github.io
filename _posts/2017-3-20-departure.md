I had the pleasure of reading A.G. Riddle's *Departure* a few years ago when a preview edition was published and the recent final revised edition I read this month was just as enjoyable -- though I still prefer the original. The final edition contained some interesting tweaks, but in general merely served to adjust the romance of the novel and add textual descriptions of the romance. In my opinion, unnecessary.

*Departure* takes place during a plane crash. The twist? The survivors find no cell signal and no civilization. They find Stonehenge encased in glass. The happen upon a sudden and violent war. An astute doctor takes control of the group quickly, but one man will not relinquish his laptop. A twisting, page-turning narrative ensues. *Departure* is a chaotic read, but a satisfying one at that. I highly recommend it along with the rest of A.G. Riddle's wonderful novels.
