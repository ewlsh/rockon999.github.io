I had the pleasure of reading A.G. Riddle's *Departure* a few years ago when a preview edition was published and the recent secondary revised edition was just as enjoyable -- though I still prefer the original. I read the final published edition of *Departure* this month and enjoyed the wild science-fiction-themed plane-crashed-driven novel once again.

The novel takes place during a plane crash. The twist? There is no cell signal, there appears to be no civilization. They find Stonehenge encased in glass. A war suddenly engulfed the survivors. An astute doctor takes control A man will not relinquish his laptop! *Departure* is a chaotic read, but a satisfying one at that. I highly recommend it along with the rest of A.G. Riddle's wonderful novels.
