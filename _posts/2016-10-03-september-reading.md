Hello possible audience!

September has been an exciting month of reading with my AP Literature class reading *I Am Malala* and beginning *1984*, personally with my numerous college applications I have kept this month a lighter reading month. I began *Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies* and enjoyed it immensely, but have put it down half-way to focus on other novels while I write my essays (as I had mentioned previously). I picked up Rick Riordan's *The Trials of Apollo* which I enjoyed for its ties to Greek mythology but despised for its occasional references to SnapChat. I also reread Rick Riordan's *The Red Pyramid*. While relatively easy reads, I enjoy these novels for the excellent connection to mythology and childhood nostalgia (if such a thing exists at the age of 17).
