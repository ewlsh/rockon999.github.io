This past Christmas I received a book entitled "Toponymity". Toponymity is the *self-proclaimed* Atlas of Words. It details and traces the origins of numerous common and unique words, including proper nouns. In the introduction it gives the example of Atlas, the Greek titan who holds up the sky. It shows that Atlas gave rise to our word atlas, but he also received his name from a Greek word meaning something along the lines of “the bearer.” Toponymity uses this amiguity of origin to illustrate how muddy language studies can be... in its first chapter. Every chapter after, Toponymity strives to create an interesting narrative of words; blending together history and language into a fun-filled nerdy read. I highly recommend it!
